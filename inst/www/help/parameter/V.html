<b>V statistics (also known as Z statistics)</b> is used in Wilcoxon signed-rank test.
</div>    
        
<h2>Formula:</h2>
<div class="formula">
$ Z = {(W - 0.5 -N * (N+1) \div 4 ) } \div {\sqrt{ { ( N * (N + 1) * (2 * N + 1 ) ) }  \div 24} }  $
</div>

<h2>Legend:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>$N = $ Total number of pairs</li>
    <li>$W = $ W is larger of $W^+$ or $W^-$</li>
</ul>
<h2>Procedure:</h2>
<div class="description">
Rank the differences without regard to the sign of the difference (i.e., rank order the absolute differences). Ignore all zero differences (i.e., pairs with equal members, x=y). Affix the original signs to the rank numbers. All pairs with equal absolute differences (ties) get the same rank: all are ranked with the mean of the rank numbers that would have been assigned if they would have been different.
Sum all positve ranks (W+) and all negative ranks (W-) and determine the total number of pairs (N).
