<b>One-way repeated-measures ANOVA</b> is used when 3 or more conditions are compared and the independent variable is a within-groups factor (same set of participants for all conditions). It can be used when the distributions are normal and when homogeneity of variances is met (i.e., the distributions have equal variances.)
</div>    
        
<h2>Conditions:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Within-subjects experimental design</li>
    <li>The number of Independent Variable is one</li>
    <li>The number of levels in Independent Variable are more than two</li>
       <li>Independent variable should consist of at least two categorical, "related groups" or matched pairs"
    </li>
    <li>The dependent variable should be measured at interval or ratio scale</li>
    <li>There should be no significant outliers in the related groups</li>
    <li>The distribution of the dependent variable in the two or more related groups should be approximately normally distributed</li>
    <li>The variances of the differences between all combinations of related groups must be equal( Sphericity)
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Examples:</h2>
<div class="example">
<b>Example 1:</b> In an effect of phone operating systems emotionally on users, three types of phone operating systems(ios,android and windows) were compared in a within-subjects experimental design. As shown in the graph below, the measured stress score was normally distributed in each condition, but they are sampled from same participants hence violating the assumption of independence condition.
